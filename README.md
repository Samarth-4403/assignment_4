Assignment: Number to Word Converter
Your task is to write a program that takes an integer as input from the user and displays the 
corresponding word for that number. For example, if the user enters "1", the program should 
display "one". The program should be able to handle numbers between 0 and 999.
Here are the rules for the conversion:
• Numbers 0 to 20 should be converted to their corresponding word (e.g.. 0 should be 
"zero", 1 should be "one", and so on).
• Numbers from 21 to 99 should be converted to words by combining the words for the 
tens place and the ones place. For example, 23 should be "twenty-three", and 99 
should be "ninety-nine".
• Numbers from 100 to 999 should be converted to words by combining the words for 
the hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place. For example, 325 should be 
"three hundred twenty-five".
Your program should display an error message if the user enters a number outside of the 
range of 0 to 99999.
Please write a Python program that meets the requirements above. Your program should 
include comments to explain your code and should be thoroughly tested with a variety of 
inputs.
